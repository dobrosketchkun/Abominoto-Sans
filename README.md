One day I thought, what if Russian and English languages were written in kanas? So I took a piece of paper on created this font. Abominoto-Sans is an abomination of [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP), and it has no purpose.

Here you can see what exactly wrong with this idea:
